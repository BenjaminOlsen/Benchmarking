# C++ Benchmarking Project

This project is a C++ benchmarking tool designed to measure the performance of different functions. It includes a customizable framework for timing and comparing various algorithms or solutions, particularly focusing on functions from the `leet.cpp` file.

## Description

The benchmarking tool is set up to test and compare the execution time of different algorithm implementations. It's currently configured to test various solutions to the "Length of Longest Substring" problem, but it can be easily adapted for other use cases.

## Features

- Benchmark multiple functions with ease.
- Generate random test data for consistent benchmarking.
- Warm-up phase to ensure more accurate measurements.
- Easy-to-read output of timing and performance results.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- C++11 or later.
- Standard C++ Library.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
